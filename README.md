# ContactsWebApi
Hi there!

This is the app on which i was practicing creating APIs to develop my skills of coding fully working, professional apps.
You can see I'm using database to store data and access it through Entity Framework. 
In accordance to good practices of coding I'm using LINQ, automapping and Repository, to make my code clean, short and as simple as it is possible. 

You can use swagger to try the api out.
